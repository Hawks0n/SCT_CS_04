# SCT_CS_04
This project demonstrates a basic keylogger implementation using Python's `pynput` library. It captures keystrokes and writes them to a local file (`key_log.txt`) in real time. The code is intended for educational and ethical use only — such as understanding input event handling, file I/O, and listener patterns in Python.
